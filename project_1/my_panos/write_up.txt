Our testing script is test.py located in the project_1 folder.
It currently runs the panoramic stitching on pre-warped images.
This is due to the images being captured on a phone and 
needing to be manually rotated after going through warp_image.
Because of this we have also hard coded the origin values in
instead of getting them from our warp_image.

Heads up, our panorama stitching runs slow.

Usage:

python test.py

This will result in an image called "our_stitched_image.png" to be created in my_panos. This is a stitch of our own 3 images taken from our cell phone. The pre-warped images are provided in my_panos.
