Our testing script is test.py located in the project_1 folder.
It currently runs the panoramic stitching on pre-warped images.
This is due to the images being captured on a phone and 
needing to be manually rotated after going through warp_image.
Because of this we have also hard coded the origin values in
instead of getting them from our warp_image.

Heads up, our panorama stitching runs slow.
